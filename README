cherf2 - "Perforates" NAT tables for p2p communication.

WHAT

  cherf2 is the second generation of https://github.com/ais-ucla/cherf.

  The idea is the same, but cherf2 is written in C99 and provides a simpler
  protocol.

DEPENDENCIES

  cherf2 requires significantly fewer dependencies than cherf. The two required
  libraries are:

   - monocypher (https://monocypher.org/) for cryptography
   - libbraid (https://github.com/christopherm99/libbraid) for cooperative
     userspace multitasking.

INSTALLATION

  After retrieving the source code, run ./configure and then make to build.
  Configuration options are available via ./configure --help.
